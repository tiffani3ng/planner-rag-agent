# Planner RAG Agent

A locally-running CLI scheduling assistant. See [CAPB.md](CAPB.md) for full design doc.

### Planner RAG — Mini-Project #3
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that ingests syllabi, task lists, and calendar exports to act as a dynamic personalized scheduler. The agent answers questions like “I have 3 hours between classes today, how should I allocate my time?” or “What do I have to get done before my vacation in two weeks?”, surfaces all relevant deadlines, and proposes feasible, balanced plans that adjust according to task completion.

## Features

* Grounded Q&A over syllabi, task lists, and calendar exports
* Personalized hour-by-hour/day-by-day planning
* Task- and deadline-aware suggestions with basic time-window reasoning
* Semantic retrieval over small, user-owned corpus (≈10–20 docs, ~100 tasks)
* Local embeddings + lightweight vector store (e.g., ChromaDB)
* Hosted LLM for fluent planning recommendations (GPT-3.5 in MVP)
